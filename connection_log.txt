FTP or File Transfer Protocol is a common way to transfer files. For FTP, Python has a built in package called ftplib.
1- Connect and login to an FTP server
2- List directories and files
3- Upload and download files


Storbinary()
Store a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate STOR command: "STOR filename". fp is a file object (opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF using its read() method

retrbinary(cmd, callback, blocksize=8192, rest=None)
Retrieve a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate RETR command: 'RETR filename'.

dir()
Produce a directory listing as returned by the LIST command, printing it to standard output.

cwd(pathname)
Set the current directory on the server.

Method	Description
pwd()-
Current working directory.

cwd()-
Change current working directory to path.

dir([path[,...[,cb]])-
Displays directory listing of path. Optional call-back cb passed to retrlines().

storlines(cmd, f)-
Uploads text file using given FTP  File successfully received from 192.168.1.180 at 2023-06-14 17:58:08
cmd - for example, STOR file name.

storbinary(cmd,f[, bs=8192])-
Similar to storlines() but is used for binary files.

delete(path)-
Deletes remote file located at path.

mkd(directory)-
Creates remote directory.

connect(host[, port[, timeout]])-
Connects to the given host and port. The default port number is 21, as specified by the FTP protocol..

quit()-
Closes connection and quits.
download.txtMultiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines 
that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.


import multiprocessing
  
def print_cube(num):
    """
    function to print cube of given num
    """
    print("Cube: {}".format(num * num * num))
  
def print_square(num):
    """
    function to print square of given num
    """
    print("Square: {}".format(num * num))

    # wait until process 1 is finished
    p1.join()
    # wait until process 2 is finished
    p2.join()
  
    # both processes finished
    print("Done!")


target: the function to be executed by process
args: the arguments to be passed to the target function

p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_square, args=(10, ))
p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_cube, args=(10, ))

To start a process, we use start method of Process class.
p1.start()
p2.start()

Once the processes start, the current program also keeps on executing. In order to stop execution of current program until a process is complete, we use join method.

A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or File successfully received from 192.168.1.180 at 2023-06-14 17:59:15

“Wireless” means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves. Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices.
Cellular phones, wireless sensors, TV remotes, satellite disc receivers, and laptops with WLAN cards are all examples of wireless devices. For data or voice communication,
a wireless network uses radiofrequency waves rather than wires.
