{local_file_path}MFM & AVH (multi functional meter) :-

it is used for measuring voltage,power, current, power factor and it tracks energy consumption.
A multi-function meter is an electrical instrument installed in panels; this device measures various electrical parameters such as voltage, 
current, power factor and active power. A multi-function meter is usually involved in settings which require an exact, reliable measure of electricity.
mfm for measuring electrical values in three phase low and high voltage network.
multifunction meter is used in energy consumption monitoring and can measure the three phases at once.
Multi function energy meter refers to the watt-hour meter which has more than two functions, such as time-sharing and measurement demand, in
addition to measuring active power (reactive power), and can display, store and output data, and has powerful data acquisition and processing 
functions. Digital multifunction meter is suitable for all common power parameters, real-time power measurement, energy measurement and power quality analysis in power grid.

Communication
Multifunction meters can transmit information about the circuit remotely and communicate with other devices. Itâ€™s possible due to electric standard RS-485 and communication protocols like MODBUS-RTU. In addition to transmitting information to servers on the cloud.


Two variations of the MODBUS protocol exist:
The MODBUS ASCII mode: where messages are transmitted as lines of hexadecimal codes
The MODBUS RTU mode: where messages are directly transmitted as binary frames
